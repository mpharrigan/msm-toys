MSM Toys
========

Various toy models for testing MSMs:

- Build a transition matrix from a continuous 2d potential
    - The Muller potential is included
    - The Muller potential can also be used as a custom external force
      in OpenMM
- Simple few-state hand-built Markov chains    

We can then sample "trajectories" from these models.
